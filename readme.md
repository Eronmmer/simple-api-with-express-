# Simple Express API

This is the code for one of my articles on building a REST API with Express and MongoDB. Read the article [here](https://erons.codes/how-to-build-a-rest-api-with-express-and-mongodb)

## Usage

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- The app should now be running on post 5000
- Now use Postman or any other client to test the routes
